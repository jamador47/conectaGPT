<h3>Build AI Agents, Visually</h3>

## 🌟 About ConectaGPT

**ConectaGPT** is born as an open source fork project of FlowiseAI, which seeks to **reduce the gap to access and manipulation of AI agents for Spanish speakers and people with little technical context**.

### 🎯 Our Mission

### ✅ Complete Rebranding

-   **Updated references**: All links and mentions changed to ConectaGPT

### ✅ Responsive Design
